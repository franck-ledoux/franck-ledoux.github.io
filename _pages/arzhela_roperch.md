__Reinforcement Learning fo Topological Optimization of Block-Structured Meshes__

_Supervision: F. Ledoux and J.-Ch. Janodet (AROBAS, IBISC, Universit√© Evry, Paris-Saclay)_

This  PhD project aims to develop a learning method based on an actor-critic algorithm, 
i.e. a temporal difference algorithm using gradient descent, composed with the use of Monte Carlo 
Tree Search, or MCTS for Monte Carlo Tree Search. An actor-critic algorithm is based on two 
components: an actor who decides which action to choose for a given state; a critic who evaluates 
the action taken by the actor and will indicate how good the action taken is and how to adjust it. 
Based on recent results, in which the PPO algorithm is used to provide a solution to a problem of 
topological modification of 2D meshes, and on the use of MCTS, we wish to propose an approach to 
modify 3D block structures. As part of the thesis, the results obtained will be confronted with 
real industrial use with test cases significant to the needs of the CEA.
