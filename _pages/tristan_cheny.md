The proposed PHD work is related to the Simulation program of the CEA DAM. Started in 1996, 
this program aims to ensure reliability of the French nuclear charges, without nuclear experiment. 
To this purpose, it relies on Numerical Simulation. Here, we focus on codes of the Simulation 
program that require to discretize studied objects under the form of a mesh. Many of these codes 
require quadrangular meshes (in 2D) or hexahedral meshes (in 3D) that are block-structured, 
with in addition a high control over the direction and size of the mesh elements. 
To our knowledge, the generation of this kind of meshes is mainly processed by hand, thanks to 
interactive softwares, which is expensive in engineer-time.
