In this work, we describe a method to partition domains adapted to the generation of quadrilateral 
and hexahedral meshes. Given a domain D, the proposed approach proceeds in two steps: first, a 
frame field is defined on a background simplicial mesh of D. Then, singular elements of this field 
are extracted to create a skeleton that partitions D. The key element of this approach is the use 
of frames: at a point P of D, a frame allows to orient the quadrilateral or the hexahedral. Thus, 
we propose a complete study of frames and frame fields. We describe the proposed method both in 
dimension two and three. The main difference between the two is in the way frame fields are
generated. In dimension 2, we solve a non-linear PDE, while in 2D, a heuristic is applied that uses 
initiallu an advancing front algorithm that takes the stability of the field into account, before 
using a smoothing algorithm. In both cases, a skeleton is extracted from the frame field. In 
dimension two, this skeleton always leads to a partition of D into quadrilateral-shaped blocks, and 
singularities are all of degree three and five. In dimension three, the obtained frame field leads 
to a partition allowing for hexahedral meshing in numerous cases. Many examples are showcased and 
compared to results obtained by existing methods.
