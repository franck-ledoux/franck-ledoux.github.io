This thesis addresses the problem of the automatic generation of purely hexahedral meshes for 
simulation codes when having a mesh carrying volume fraction data as an input, meaning that there 
can be several materials inside one cell. The proposed approach should create an hexahedral mesh 
where each cell corresponds to a single material, and where interfaces between materials form smooth 
surfaces. From a theoretical standpoint, we aim at adapting and extending state-of-the-art 
techniques and we apply them on examples, some classically issued from CAD models (and imprinted 
onto a mesh to obtain volume fractions), some procedurally generated cases and others in an 
intercode capacity where we take the results of a first simulation code to be our inputs. We first 
define a metric that allows the evaluation of our (or others') results and a method to improve those; 
we then introduce a discrete material interface reconstruction method inspired from the scientific 
visualization field and finally we present an algorithmic pipeline, called {sc ELG}, that offers a 
guarantee on the mesh quality by performing geometrical and topological mesh adaptation.
