This thesis studies polycube methods for the generation of hexahedral meshes. These meshes, and more 
generally block structured meshes, are very much in demand for numerical simulations of physical 
phenomena (nuclear fission, flow, aerospace...). However, there is no industrially viable method to 
generate them. We are studying a family of methods that show great promise in filling this gap: 
global parametrization methods. To date, there are still many robustness problems, which we try to 
correct. For this purpose, we focus on the subfamily of polycube methods. To obtain a hexahedral 
mesh of a domain with polycubes - clusters of unit cubes -, the procedure is the following: the 
boundary of the domain is colored, then deformed according to these colors to have its boundary 
aligned with the axes, which makes it a extit{polycuboid}. This extit{polycuboid} is then intersected 
with a grid to give a polycube. Applying the inverse deformation on this polycube gives us a 
hexahedral mesh. We make two major contributions to this procedure: first, a method that allows to 
compute the deformation efficiently and with guarantees that it will be of good quality. Second, we 
introduce a new robust method to perform the grid intersection and deformation inversion steps. 
Finally, we present avenues of study for the difficult step of coloring, the last brick necessary to 
have robust methods for generating polycube-based hexahedral meshes.
