This thesis deals with the representation and generation of block-structured hexahedral meshes. 
To date, there is no method for generating satisfactory block structures for any geometric domain. 
In practice, expert engineers generate these meshes using interactive software, which can take 
several weeks to complete. Moreover, adding modification operations in these interactive softwares 
is a delicate task to maintain the coherence of the block structure and its relationship with the 
geometric domain to be discretized. In order to improve this process, we first propose to define 
hexahedral mesh manipulation operations based on the use of the generalized map model. Then, by 
considering block structures obtained using the Polycube method, we provide methods for optimizing 
the topology of these structures to satisfy constraints of a geometric nature. We propose a first 
method in dimension 2, which considers a local approach to the problem based on the experience of 
engineers working with interactive software. We then propose a second method, this time using ant 
colony optimization meta-heuristics for leaf selection in dimension 3.
