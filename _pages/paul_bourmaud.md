__Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Hexahedral Blocking__

_Supervision: J.-Ch. Janodet (AROBAS, IBISC, Universit√© Evry, Paris-Saclay) and F. Ledoux_

Preparing high-fidelity simulations that requires block-structured hexahedral meshes is extremely 
time consuming : highly skilled engineers have to manually decompose CAD models into a set of 
hex-meshable structured blocks. This manual process, called the blocking stage, is a bottleneck 
for incremental design and sensitivity analysis: current approaches fail to propose an automatic 
solution to any 3D shapes. However, as engineers are able to create such meshes using interactive 
tools, we strongly believe that machine learning techniques are worth investigating. 

The aim of the thesis is to participate to  develop and test a Reinforcement Learning framework 
dedicated to decompose a CAD model into ready-to-use hex-meshable blocks. We mainly focus on the usage
of Monte-Carlo Tree Search in this work.
